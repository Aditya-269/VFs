Machine Learning & AI Details
Body Type Analysis
The AI-driven fashion stylist utilizes computer vision to analyze images of the user. Using TensorFlow models, the app detects key body shape features and maps them to style recommendations.

Outfit Recommendations
The machine learning models take into account user preferences (e.g., favorite colors, styles, or types of clothing) and body type to suggest the most suitable outfits. 

Wardrobe Management
The app allows users to upload photos of their clothes.
